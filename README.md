Implemented Functionalities: 

- The third-person controller includes a free-look camera powered by Cinemachine.
- The playerâ€™s movement is controlled by the camera rotation, ensuring that forward direction aligns with the camera's view, with the ability to move left, right, forward, and backward.
- Jumping mechanics allow players to jump onto elevated platforms, with adjustable movement and jump parameters.
- The environment is composed of a large flat plane with boxes to jump onto, and invisible walls to prevent the player falling off.
- Rotatable coins are placed on top of boxes, rotate, and are collected by the player.
- Upon collection by the player, the coins disappear and the UI score is updated accordingly.

Bonus Features: 

- The double-jump attribute allows the player to perform an additional jump while in mid-air.
- Dash feature to gain a quick burst of speed in any chosen direction.
